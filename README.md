Data processing challenge using accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## How to use the script
1) Download the data, unzip the folder and rename it to data for convenience under linux and unix.
2) Run the run_analysis.R script
3) The script creates a tidy data set saved as tidy_data.txt in your working directory.

## The codebook
Check out the codebook.md above to follow the transformations step.
